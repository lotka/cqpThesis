\section{Results}
% General structure.
% Display spectrums, try to calculate quality factor at least.
% Display some prelimary purities.
% Some stuff I probably should have calculated:
% Powers in the waveguide, peak power

This chip was used to do an initial proof of concept that the JSI of a ring resonator could be measured. Here the aim was to explore different ring geometries and develop an intuition on how to do the experiment. The Pritel pulsed laser was used with a pulse duration of \SI{2}{\pico\second}, a FWHM of \SI{1.0}{\nano\meter} with wavelength range \SI{1530}{\nano\meter} to \SI{1530}{\nano\meter} and a peak power of \SI{100}{\watt}. Due to the laser sometimes destroying the side coupler a \SI{3}{\decibel} attenuator was added to just after the laser output.
