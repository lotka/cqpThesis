\section{Detailed Background and Theory}
\subsection{Integrated silicon photonics}
Integrated silicon photonics is a promising new platform on which to conduct quantum information experiments. 
\subsection{On chip four wave mixing}
Want to talk about some hamiltonians.
\subsection{Ring Resonators}
Ring resonators are used as single photon sources. However to understand their behaviour to first order no quantum mechanics is needed. 
\subsection{Bistability}
\subsection{Self phase modulation}
\subsection{Schmidt Rank and Purity}
